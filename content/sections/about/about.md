I'm a 20-year-old programmer who enjoys creating websites.

My primary focus has been in web development where I've worked with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with frameworks such as React.js, Node.js, and Firebase.

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor of computer science degree at the University of Waterloo.
