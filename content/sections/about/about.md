I'm a 20-year-old programmer who enjoys creating websites in my spare time.

It had always been a dream of mine to make a game. After a month of planning and studying C# and Unity, I published my first-ever program, Pong Simulator, to SourceForge. After completing this project, I realized that a job as a software engineer was the best fit for me.

By the time I had graduated high school, COVID had forced everyone to live their lives online. Around this time, I had engrossed myself in the realm of web development. I spent my whole summer break learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Firebase to build a social networking app. This was when I discovered my passion for web programming.

Web development inspires me because it has given me complete freedom to employ my creative skills. It's like an endless canvas on which I can paint anything from Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa to Jackson Pollock's Number 5. It provides you with the potential to enhance everyone's life with just a few lines on a computer, in my opinion.
