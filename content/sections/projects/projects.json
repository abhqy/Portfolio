      "description": "An npm package that allows users to automate admin dashboards for React applications. Created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, adhering to the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.

Used a Google OAuth 2.0 Passport.js strategy to allow user authentication and cookie generation. Developed a dashboards info web application using TypeScript, React, AntD v4 and Recharts.",
